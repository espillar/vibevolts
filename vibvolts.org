Ok, lots of today has so far just been figuring out git and github and
emacs and remembering those commands.  I think I just need to download
a nice git single page to put in my desk references.

I don't know how this is going to work: but I'm going to try it out!
OK, I'm seeing that I can actually do some editing on this in github 
itslef.  It's OK I guess.  

It's rather interesting to be moving these things around between github
and other locations so quickly, and being able to edit thigns everywhere.

OK, the next action I need to do is to actually get radiometry working,
and stuff like that.
